summary: I create kinetic sculptures that invite steel, wood, and glass to dance with air, vibration, and subtle human presence. Inspired by the mechanics of insect wings, the swings of old clocks, and everyday rituals, my work transforms unnoticed movements into rhythms that reveal the hidden choreography of place. Each piece encourages quiet observation and playful interaction, turning the ordinary into a site of wonder.

My work begins with wind and ends with rhythm. I am fascinated by the unnoticed movements that govern our lives—the subtle swaying of grass, the imperceptible shift of shadows across a wall, the tidal pulse of breath that carries us from dawn to sleep. My sculptures are collaborations with these invisible forces. By giving steel, wood, and glass a chance to dance with air currents, I am inviting the environment to finish the artwork for me. What I make is not still, and therefore, never fully finished.

I draw inspiration from the mechanics of insect wings, the pendulum swings of old clocks, and the ritual motions of daily human life—stirring tea, hanging laundry, pacing while thinking. I use simple materials, but they are carefully tuned so that the smallest nudge—a breeze, a passerby’s presence, a vibration in the floor—sets them in motion. I want my pieces to remind viewers that movement is a kind of conversation: we touch the world, and the world answers back.

Ultimately, my sculptures are experiments in patience and perception. They reward the slow observer—the one who lingers long enough to notice a sudden spin, a gradual oscillation, a flash of sunlight refracting through a moving panel. Each piece is a kind of clock that doesn’t tell time but instead reveals the hidden choreography of a particular place. If you stand quietly enough, you can feel that choreography in your body, and perhaps find yourself moving in response.
